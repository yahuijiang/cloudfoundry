# dea_ng

This repository contains the code for the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA)
and related components.

## Components

### DEA

The DEA itself is written in Ruby and takes care of managing an
application instance's lifecycle. It can be instructed by the [Cloud
Controller][cc] to start and stop application instances. It keeps track
of all started instances, and periodically broadcasts messages about
their state over [NATS][nats] (meant to be picked up by the [Health
Manager][hm]).

The advantages of this generation of the DEA over the previous (and
first) generation DEA is that is more modular and has better test
coverage. A breaking change between the two is that this version of the
DEA depends on [Warden][warden] to run application instances.

[warden]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/warden

### Directory server

The directory server is written in Go and can be found in the `go/`
directory. It is a replacement for the older directory server that was
embedded in the DEA itself.

Requests for directories/files are handled by the DEA, which responds
with a HTTP redirect to a URL that hits the directory server directly.
The URL is signed by the DEA, and the directory server checks the
validity of the URL with the DEA before serving it.


## Usage

You can run the dea executable at the command line by passing the path
to a YAML configuration file:

```shell
bin/dea config/dea.yml
```

### Configuration

The following is a partial list of the keys that are read from the YAML file:

* `logging` - a [Steno configuration](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/steno#from-yaml-file)
* `nats_servers` - an array of URIs of the form `nats://host:port` that the DEA will use to connect to NATS.
* `warden_socket` - the path to a unix domain socket that the DEA will use to communicate to a warden server.

### Running the DEA in the provided Vagrant VM

When contributing to DEA it's useful to run it as a standalone
component.

[vagrant]: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Follow these steps to set up DEA to run locally on your computer:

```shell
# clone the repo
cd ~/workspace
git clone http://github.com/cloudfoundry/dea_ng
cd dea_ng
git submodule update --init
bundle install

```

## Testing

The DEA integration tests run against real Warden, directory, and NATS servers, so they must be run
in a [Vagrant][vagrant] VM. The `bin` directory contains a helper script that runs the entire DEA test suite:

[vagrant]: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

```bash

# Checkout the repo
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dea_ng

# Verify that Vagrant version is at least 1.5
vagrant --version

# Ensure the guest additions plugin is installed
# NOTE: On mac, we had to 
# export NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=true

vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

# Run test suite in Vagrant vm
bin/test_in_vm
```
Note that the integration tests stage and run real applications, which requires an internet connection.
They take 5-10 minutes to run, depending on your connection speed.

To run tests individually, there is a bit of setup:

```bash

#shell into the VM
vagrant ssh

# pull the latest warden
cd /warden
#start warden
cd /warden/warden
sudo bundle install
sudo bundle exec rake warden:start[config/test_vm.yml] &> /tmp/warden.log &

# start the DEA's dependencies
cd /vagrant
sudo bundle install
sudo bundle exec foreman start &> /tmp/foreman.log &

#To run the tests (unit, integration or all):
bundle install
bundle exec rspec spec/{spec_file_name}
```

To watch the internal NATS traffic while the tests run, do this
in another ssh session:

```
nats-sub ">" -s nats://localhost:4222
```

## Staging

See [staging.rb](lib/dea/responders/staging.rb) for staging flow.

### NATS Messaging

- `staging.advertise`: Stagers (now DEA's) broadcast their capacity/capability

- `staging.locate`: Stagers respond to any message on this subject with a
  `staging.advertise` message (CC uses this to bootstrap)

- `staging.<uuid>.start`: Stagers respond to requests on this subject to stage apps

- `staging`: Stagers (in a queue group) respond to requests to stage an app
  (old protocol)

## Warden rootfs

For details about how to use and update the Warden rootfs, see [the stacks documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stacks).

## Logs

The DEA's logging is handled by [Steno](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/steno).
The DEA can be configured to log to a file, a syslog server or both. If neither is provided,
it will log to its stdout.

The following log levels exist, shown with an example of what they are used for:
* `error` - DEA failed to download builpack cache, cannot create PID file
* `warn` - DEA failed to destroy a warden container, DEA received invalid JSON message over NATS
* `info` - DEA is shutting down, DEA received a request to stage/run an app, but didn't have the resources
* `debug2` - DEA received request for instance information, but was not running the specified app
* `debug` - DEA saved a snapshot, downloaded a droplet

### Log Topics

* droplet.* - logging relevant to an app's instance
* staging.* - logging relevant to the staging of an app's bits
* dea.* - component-level logging for the DEA itself
